ðŸ§  GreenScreens: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models for Mental Health Classification Using MHI-5 Mental Health Screening Tool.

Description:

GreenScreens is a comparative study that evaluates the performance of four classical machine learning modelsâ€”Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and XGBoostâ€”in predicting mental health outcomes. The target variable is the Mental Health Inventory-5 (MHI-5), a binary indicator reflecting overall mental well-being. The objective is to determine which machine learning model most accurately predicts and/or classifies MHI-5 outcomes.

The project was carried out as part of an academic research effort and is accompanied by a full report that includes a literature review, detailed methodology, and results. It was conducted under the supervision of Dr. Marijn van Wingerden, PhD, Associate Professor. The project received a final grade of 8.5.
