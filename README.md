ðŸ§  Green Screens: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models for Mental Health Classification Using MHI-5
Description
Green Screens is a comparative study that evaluates the performance of four classical machine learning modelsâ€”Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and XGBoostâ€”in predicting mental health outcomes. The target variable is the Mental Health Inventory-5 (MHI-5), a binary indicator reflecting overall mental well-being. The objective is to determine which machine learning model most accurately predicts and/or classifies MHI-5 outcomes.
